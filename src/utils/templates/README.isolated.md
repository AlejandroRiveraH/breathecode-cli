# Hello World 

Welcome teacher! This is how any tutorial step is distributed:

1. The `app.[ext]` file will be the initial boilerplate (delete the app file if you only want to show the readme)
2. The `test.[ext]` file will do the grading (delete the test file if not needed).
3. You can have any other files as needed and they will automatically open when the students arrives to the exercise.
4. You can hide a file so that it does not open automatically by adding `.hidden.` under its name, for example: `solution.hidden.js`.
